# Hesperus - Permitting Clarity in the Skies

## Teammates
#### Derek Warner - Project Lead
I am an engineering physics major with a specialization in computational physics, and a minor in computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have extensive academic experience in computer science, advanced math and physics (and also Italian!), with a special interest in high performance computing and data science/engineering. I am practiced prominently in Python and Rust development, but I am capable also in C++ and Typescript/Javascript -- with the hope to learn many more! I have an extensive history in academic research, and I am an upcoming software engineer at Acorns.

Feel free to contact me anytime through email (derekw3@illinois.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwarbler/)

## Overview
Hesperus is a software which utilizes the ADS-B airplane broadcasting protocol to provide both an easily digestible interface for flight tracking, but also more advanced features such as possible collision detection, hyperbolic location based plane triangulation, signal validation and more. This provides a secure airplane tracking system with features like broadcast validation, all which can be used in a GPS-free manner.
